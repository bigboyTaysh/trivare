# AI Rules for Frontend Development

This file contains rules and guidelines for frontend development in the Trivare project.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend (Client/)**
- Astro 5 - Modern web framework with islands architecture
- React 19 - Interactive UI components
- TypeScript 5 - Type safety
- Tailwind CSS 4 - Utility-first styling
- Shadcn/ui - Reusable React components

## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below for the frontend:

```
Client/          # Astro + React frontend
  src/
    components/  # React/Astro components
    pages/       # Astro pages (routing)
    services/    # API integration
    layouts/     # Page layouts
    config/      # Configuration
```

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
