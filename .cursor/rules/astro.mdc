# AI Rules for Astro Components

This file contains rules and guidelines for Astro components in the Trivare project.

## General Guidelines

- Use Astro for static content and layouts.
- Prefer Astro components for UI that doesn't require client-side interactivity.
- Use `client:load`, `client:idle`, or `client:visible` directives to hydrate React components where necessary.

## Component Structure

- Keep the component script (`---`) at the top of the file.
- Follow with the component's HTML template.
- Use `<style>` tags for component-scoped CSS.
