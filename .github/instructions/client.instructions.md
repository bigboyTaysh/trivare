## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Configure project-specific rules in eslint.config.js to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Implement custom rules for {{project_specific_patterns}} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code

#### PRETTIER

- Define a consistent .prettierrc configuration
- Configure editor integration to format on save for immediate feedback
- Use .prettierignore to exclude generated files, build artifacts, and specific excluded patterns
- Set printWidth based on team preferences (80-120 characters) to improve code readability
- Configure consistent quote style and semicolon usage to match team conventions
- Implement CI checks to ensure all committed code adheres to the defined style


## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for data fetching heavy components when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive


### Guidelines for ASTRO

#### ASTRO_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Implement framework components only when interactivity is needed
- Leverage View Transitions API for smooth page transitions
- Use content collections with type safety for blog posts, documentation, etc.
- Implement middleware for request/response modification
- Use image optimization with the Astro Image integration
- Leverage Server Endpoints for API routes
- Implement hybrid rendering with server-side rendering where needed
- Use Astro.cookies for server-side cookie management
- Leverage import.meta.env for environment variables


### Guidelines for STYLING

#### TAILWIND

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

## DEVOPS

### Guidelines for CI_CD

#### GITHUB_ACTIONS

- Check if `package.json` exists in project root and summarize key scripts
- Check if `.nvmrc` exists in project root
- Check if `.env.example` exists in project root to identify key `env:` variables
- Always use terminal command: `git branch -a | cat` to verify whether we use `main` or `master` branch
- Always use `env:` variables and secrets attached to jobs instead of global workflows
- Always use `npm ci` for Node-based dependency setup
- Extract common steps into composite actions in separate files
- Once you're done, as a final step conduct the following: for each public action always use <tool>"Run Terminal"</tool> to see what is the most up-to-date version (use only major version) - extract tag_name from the response:
- ```bash curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest ```


## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### JEST

- Use Jest with TypeScript for type checking in tests
- Implement Testing Library for component testing instead of enzyme
- Use snapshot testing sparingly and only for stable UI components
- Leverage mock functions and spies for isolating units of code
- Implement test setup and teardown with beforeEach and afterEach
- Use describe blocks for organizing related tests
- Leverage expect assertions with specific matchers
- Implement code coverage reporting with meaningful targets
- Use mockResolvedValue and mockRejectedValue for async testing
- Leverage fake timers for testing time-dependent functionality
