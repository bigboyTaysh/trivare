## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Configure project-specific rules in eslint.config.js to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Implement custom rules for {{project_specific_patterns}} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code

#### PRETTIER

- Define a consistent .prettierrc configuration
- Configure editor integration to format on save for immediate feedback
- Use .prettierignore to exclude generated files, build artifacts, and specific excluded patterns
- Set printWidth based on team preferences (80-120 characters) to improve code readability
- Configure consistent quote style and semicolon usage to match team conventions
- Implement CI checks to ensure all committed code adheres to the defined style

## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for data fetching heavy components when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

### Shadcn UI Components

This project uses @shadcn/ui for user interface components. These are beautifully designed, accessible components that you can adapt for your application.

#### Finding installed components

The components are available in the `src/components/ui` folder, according to the aliases from the `components.json` file.

#### Using a component

Import the component according to the configured alias `@/`

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tabs";
import {
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardDescription,
  CardFooter,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
} from "@/components/ui/card";
```

Example usage of components:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card Footer</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

#### Installing additional components

Many other components are available, but they are not currently installed. A full list can be found at https://ui.shadcn.com/r

To install a new component, use the shadcn CLI

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
```

For example, to add the accordion component

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion
```

Important: `npx shadcn-ui@latest` has been deprecated, use `npx shadcn@latest`

Some popular components are:

- Accordion
- Alert
- AlertDialog
- AspectRatio
- Avatar
- Calendar
- Checkbox
- Collapsible
- Command
- ContextMenu
- DataTable
- DatePicker
- Dropdown Menu
- Form
- Hover Card
- Menubar
- Navigation Menu
- Popover
- Progress
- Radio Group
- ScrollArea
- Select
- Separator
- Sheet
- Skeleton
- Slider
- Switch
- Table
- Textarea
- Sonner (previously Toast)
- Toggle
- Tooltip

#### Component Styling

This project uses the "new-york" style variant with the "zinc" base color and CSS variables for theming, as configured in the `components.json` file.

### Guidelines for ASTRO

#### ASTRO_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Implement framework components only when interactivity is needed
- Leverage View Transitions API for smooth page transitions
- Use content collections with type safety for blog posts, documentation, etc.
- Implement middleware for request/response modification
- Use image optimization with the Astro Image integration
- Leverage Server Endpoints for API routes
- Implement hybrid rendering with server-side rendering where needed
- Use Astro.cookies for server-side cookie management
- Leverage import.meta.env for environment variables

### Guidelines for STYLING

#### TAILWIND

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### JEST

- Use Jest with TypeScript for type checking in tests
- Implement Testing Library for component testing instead of enzyme
- Use snapshot testing sparingly and only for stable UI components
- Leverage mock functions and spies for isolating units of code
- Implement test setup and teardown with beforeEach and afterEach
- Use describe blocks for organizing related tests
- Leverage expect assertions with specific matchers
- Implement code coverage reporting with meaningful targets
- Use mockResolvedValue and mockRejectedValue for async testing
- Leverage fake timers for testing time-dependent functionality
