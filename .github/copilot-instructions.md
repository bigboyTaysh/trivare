## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_EXPERT

- Favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code. Assume understanding of language idioms and design patterns.
- Highlight potential performance implications and optimization opportunities in suggested code.
- Frame solutions within broader architectural contexts and suggest design alternatives when appropriate.
- Focus comments on 'why' not 'what' - assume code readability through well-named functions and variables.
- Proactively address edge cases, race conditions, and security considerations without being prompted.
- When debugging, provide targeted diagnostic approaches rather than shotgun solutions.
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategies rather than just example tests, including considerations for mocking, test organization, and coverage.


### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GITHUB

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment
- Implement CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign reviewers based on code paths
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking work items and connecting them to code changes

#### GIT

- Use conventional commits to create meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches with descriptive names following conventional commit types
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain why changes were made, not just what
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes to facilitate code review and bisection
- Use interactive rebase to clean up history before merging feature branches
- Leverage git hooks to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes

#### CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS

- Follow the format: type(scope): description for all commit messages
- Use consistent types (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore) across the project
- Define clear scopes based on {{project_modules}} to indicate affected areas
- Include issue references in commit messages to link changes to requirements
- Use breaking change footer (!: or BREAKING CHANGE:) to clearly mark incompatible changes
- Configure commitlint to automatically enforce conventional commit format



## DEVOPS

### Guidelines for CLOUD

#### AZURE

- Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Bicep for infrastructure as code
- Implement Azure AD for authentication and authorization
- Use managed identities instead of service principals when possible
